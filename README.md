# Drum-Kit

The way that this works is that we've got a number of keys here that represent different drums in a typical drum set. 
And when we click on any of these buttons then we'll get the corresponding sound of the drum.

And in addition, we can also use the keys on the keyboard to produce the corresponding sound of the drum.
